# Current work

I lead and contribute to projects that sit at the intersection of **ecology**, **resilience**, and **sustainability**—spanning wildfire, marine systems, and food production. Collaboration is central to how I work.

## Wildfire in the West

Building understanding and tools for **wildfire resilience** in western landscapes—working with partners to link ecology, risk, and community needs. This work connects systems thinking on the ground with data and decision support (e.g. [Wildfire Resilience Index](https://wildfireindex.org/)).

## Trait-based framework for seaweed ecology

Advancing a **trait-based framework** for marine macroalgae to better understand ecology, resilience, and sustainable use. I'm developing this line of work with collaborators and am keen to expand partnerships—especially where traits meet aquaculture, restoration, or climate adaptation.

## Sustainable food production

Exploring how **sustainability** in food production can be understood and supported across systems—from aquaculture to terrestrial agriculture. Food systems are a critical nexus for resilience, equity, and ecology; I'm interested in research that connects these dimensions.
