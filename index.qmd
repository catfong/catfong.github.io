## Systems ecology for resilience and sustainability

I work across marine and terrestrial systems to understand how ecological and social systems respond to change. From trait-based frameworks for seaweed and aquaculture to wildfire resilience and sustainable food production, my research focuses on building resilience at multiple scales—and on partnerships that connect science to practice.

## Linking land, water, and people

My work spans ecosystems from forests to coral reefs. I'm interested in how we can understand and support resilience across these systems—and in collaborations that cross boundaries between disciplines, sectors, and places.
